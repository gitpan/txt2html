txt2html version 2.35
======================

HTML::TextToHTML converts plain text files into HTML.  The txt2html
script uses this module to do the same from the command-line.

It supports headings, tables, lists, simple character markup, and
hyperlinking, and is highly customizable. It recognizes some of the
apparent structure of the source document (mostly whitespace and
typographic layout), and attempts to mark that structure explicitly
using HTML. The purpose for this tool is to provide an easier way of
converting existing text documents to HTML format, giving something
nicer than just whapping the text in a PRE block.

HISTORY

The original txt2html script was written by Seth Golub (see
http://www.aigeek.com/txt2html/), and converted to a perl module by
Kathryn Andersen (see http://www.katspace.com/tools/text_to_html/) and
made into a sourceforge project by Sun Tong (see
http://sourceforge.net/projects/txt2html/).  Earlier versions of the
HTML::TextToHTML module called the included script texthyper so as not
to clash with the original txt2html script, but now the projects have
all been merged.
