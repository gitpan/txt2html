txt2html Installation
=====================

INSTALLATION

Make sure you have the dependencies installed first!
(see DEPENDENCIES below)

To install this module type the following:

   perl Build.PL
   ./Build
   ./Build test
   ./Build install

Or, if you're on a platform (like DOS or Windows) that doesn't like the
"./" notation, you can do this:

   perl Build.PL
   perl Build
   perl Build test
   perl Build install

In order to install somewhere other than the default, such as
in a directory under your home directory, like "/home/fred/perl"
go

   perl Build.PL --install_base /home/fred/perl

as the first step instead.

This will install the files underneath /home/fred/perl.

You will then need to make sure that you alter the PERL5LIB variable to
find the modules, and the PATH variable to find the script.

Therefore you will need to change:
your path, to include /home/fred/perl/script (where the script will be)

	PATH=/home/fred/perl/script:${PATH}

the PERL5LIB variable to add /home/fred/perl/lib

	PERL5LIB=/home/fred/perl/lib:${PERL5LIB}

Note that the system links dictionary will be installed as
"/home/fred/perl/share/txt2html/txt2html.dict

See "perldoc perlrun" for more information on PERL5LIB, and
see "perldoc Module::Build" for more information on
installation options.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

    Module::Build
    Getopt::Long
    Getopt::ArgvFile
    Pod::Usage
    File::Basename
    File::Spec

For testing, it also needs:

    Test::More

If you don't want to install this, don't do "build test" above.

For debugging, it also needs:

    Data::Dumper

Some of these modules come standard with more recent versions of perl,
but I thought I'd mention them anyway, just in case you may not have
them.

If you don't know how to install these, try using the CPAN module, an
easy way of auto-installing modules from the Comprehensive Perl Archive
Network, where the above modules reside.
Do "perldoc perlmodinstall" or "perldoc CPAN" for more information.
