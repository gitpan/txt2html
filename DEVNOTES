Developer Notes
===============

When incrementing the VERSION, do it in two places:
- TextToHTML.pm
- txt2html.PL
This is because the version of the whole package is taken from the module,
and it would be very confusing if the script version was different,
considering they're distributed in the same bundle.

All new options need to be added in five places:
- TextToHTML.pm init_our_args(), to initialize the default
- TextToHTML.pm args() in the parse-the-array-ref part, unless
  it is a simple option-with-a-value.  If it is a boolean option,
  it also needs to be added in its "no" form.
- TextToHTML.pm OPTIONS documentation
- txt2html.PL Getopt call, including its type and possible shortnames
- txt2html.PL OPTIONS documentation

If you want to change the location or name of the default system link
dictionary, it needs to be changed in four places:
- Makefile.PL
- TextToHTML.pm init_our_args()
- TextToHTML.pm OPTIONS documentation
- txt2html.PL OPTIONS documentation
