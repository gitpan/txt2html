Developer Notes
===============

When incrementing the VERSION, do it in two places:
- TextToHTML.pm
- txt2html
This is because the version of the whole package is taken from the module,
and it would be very confusing if the script version was different,
considering they're distributed in the same bundle.
One also needs to change the META tag in
- tfiles/good_sample.html
- tfiles/good_xhtml_sample.html
so that the version there matches the new current version.

All new options need to be added in five places:
- TextToHTML.pm init_our_args(), to initialize the default
- TextToHTML.pm args() in the parse-the-array-ref part, unless
  it is a simple option-with-a-value.  If it is a boolean option,
  it also needs to be added in its "no" form.
- TextToHTML.pm OPTIONS documentation
- txt2html Getopt call, including its type and possible shortnames
- txt2html OPTIONS documentation

If you want to change the location or name of the default system link
dictionary, it needs to be changed in four places:
- Makefile.PL
- TextToHTML.pm init_our_args()
- TextToHTML.pm OPTIONS documentation
- txt2html OPTIONS documentation
