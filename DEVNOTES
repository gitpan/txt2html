Developer Notes
===============

Note that TextToHTML.pm is generated from TextToHTML.in, so don't waste
time editing the .pm file. Likewise, edit the txt2html.in file if you
want to change the script.

When incrementing the VERSION, do it in two places:
- TextToHTML.in
- txt2html.in
This is because the version of the whole package is taken from the module,
and it would be very confusing if the script version was different,
considering they're distributed in the same bundle.

One also needs to change it in the README file.

One also needs to change the META tag in tfiles/good_*.html (the ones
that have a META tag) so that the version there matches the new current
version.

All new options need to be added in five places:
- TextToHTML.in init_our_args(), to initialize the default
- TextToHTML.in args() in the parse-the-array-ref part, unless
  it is a simple option-with-a-value.  If it is a boolean option,
  it also needs to be added in its "no" form.
- TextToHTML.in OPTIONS documentation
- txt2html.in Getopt call, including its type and possible shortnames
- txt2html.in OPTIONS documentation

If you want to change the location of the default system link
dictionary, it needs to be changed in the MyBuilder.pm file, as
that is where the location is calculated, and where the UpdatePath.PL
file gets it from in order to change it in the .in files.
(Note that this is only for changing the default location; the location
obeys the install_base option of Build.PL when that's called.)

If you want to change the *name* of the default system link dictionary,
it needs to be changed in:
- MyBuilder.pm
- TextToHTML.in init_our_args()
- TextToHTML.in OPTIONS documentation
- txt2html OPTIONS documentation

Release Notes
=============

Before releasing, don't forget to run

	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build dist

(and usually "Build install" as well)

This bundle is released in three different external places:
- CPAN
- Sourceforge
- FreshMeat

CPAN Release
------------

Log in to PAUSE, and browser-upload the .tar.gz file.  Simple, huh?

Sourceforge Release
-------------------

Do a CVS commit if you haven't already.

Go to the Admin/Files section and follow the instructions.
You will need to ftp upload the .tar.gz file to upload.sourceforge.net
/incoming directory before doing certain steps.

One also needs to update the web-page.  Cd to txt2html_web/htdocs on
your home machine, and edit index.html to update the version number.
Then do
	make del_cpfiles
	make cpfiles
	make
	cvs commit

Then log in to txt2html.sourceforge.net, cd to the
/home/groups/.../txt2html directory, and run "getweb" and this
will update the website from CVS.

One should also post a message to the mailing list.

FreshMeat Release
-----------------

Log in to freshmeat.net, and follow the instructions for new releases.
The "changes this release" will need to be a summary of the changes.
Since the file is on sourceforge, you won't need to alter the download
URL.
